Cyber Risk Analytics

Cyber attacks have been occuring at a consistently high rate and have become an inevitable struggle for the businesses. The number of attacks and breaches have exponentially increased with hackers having access to better tools and technologies in launching attacks. The FBI reports state that more than 4000 ransonware attacks occur everyday and facebook accounts are hacked upto 600,000 times in a single day. 

Hackers use different types of threat vectors to gain access, steal, threaten or damage the organization's information. These include malware, phishing attacks, cross site scripting, sql injection, ransomware, remote code executions, social engineering etc. 

In this project, using tableau data visualization tool, I have generated reports to show-

•	Proportion of different attack vectors used in 2018 to carry out a cyber-attack (Source: Hackmageddon)

•	2017 vs 2018 cyber crime statistics

•	Top 20 countries in the world that encountered cyber attacks during 2018

•	Top 10 companies that have undergone huge revenue losses because of cyber attacks between 2010 - 2019
